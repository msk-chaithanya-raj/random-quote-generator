## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: A React framework for server-rendered applications.

## Concepts Covered

1. **Next.js App Router**:

   - Using the `app` directory for routing.
   - Creating a `page.tsx` file for the homepage.

2. **API Routes**:

   - Creating an API route (`app/api/quote/route.ts`) to serve random quotes.

3. **Client Components**:

   - Using the `"use client"` directive to mark components that use React hooks like `useState`.

4. **State Management**:

   - Using `useState` to manage the quote and loading state.

5. **Styling**:

   - Using TailwindCSS for responsive and modern styling.

6. **Fetching Data**:
   - Using the `fetch` API to call the local API route.
